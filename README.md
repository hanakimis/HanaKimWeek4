This is Hana Kim's submission for the assignment (Carousel prototype) for Week 4 in the Codepath, September 2014 iOS for Designers class.


**Time Spent:** 10.5 Hours


#### Completed User Stories

* Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.

* Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.

* On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.

* If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.

* **Optional**: The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.


#### Incomplete User Stories
* **Optional**: The full screen photo should be zoomable. (**Note**: I had originally completed this particular user story before doing the paging portion, but this piece ended up breaking after I did the paging. I think I know how to fix it by turning off and hiding the images that aren't being zoomed, but ran out of time. Also, I was having difficulty getting the minimum zoom to work. Finally, when I zoomed in either direction too much, the application interpreted the zooming as scrolling in directions and mimicked the drag-to-release action. Don't know how to prevent this.)
